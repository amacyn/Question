                I don’t need to tell anyone 
                that building a business is really, really hard. That’s obvious.
                But in my experience⁠—and based on what I’ve learned from other founders 
                I’ve spoken with⁠—it’s even harder to build a business when you’re not 
                scratching your own itch. Ultimately, it’s that passion for solving my own 
                problem that keeps me going through the lowest of the lows,
                and I know that many other founders feel the same way.

                While PR isn’t a strategy that we’re pursuing at the moment, 
                it is something that we’ve done before,
                and it’s something that can be very useful for the right businesses.
                The problem is that most people go about it completely wrong.

                I had been a product guy for my entire career, working side-by-side with developers,
                so I had a bit of helpful experience when it came to actually hiring one, 
                though we’ve certainly had our stumbles along the way.
                If you’re looking for a developer to help you get your idea off of the ground, 
                there are three things I’d recommend:
                <br>*Get comfortable⁠—and good at⁠—selling.
                <br>*Consider hiring a developer on a project basis.
                <br>*If you can swing it, consider hiring an agency to build your prototype.
